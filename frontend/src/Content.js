Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse's performance. The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse's fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse's willingness to learn. Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical. A horse's skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least four years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.";

Advertisements are also available in trade magazines. A few times a year, including in connection with the Elite Race in the spring and the Swedish Trotting Criterium in the autumn, trotting horse auctions are arranged in Sweden. Young horses are usually sold, but on occasion occasional competition horses and foals are also offered.
